  <p>Hello, my name is Mateo Asin, I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the University of Warwick.</p>

  <p>I am currently in my 4th and final year of an MMath degree with my favourite modules being Financial
    Mathematics and Stochastic Processes. </p>

  <p> Please feel free to browse my website. You can find different ways to contact me on the contact section.</p>

<h2> Hobbies and Interests</h2>
  <p> First and foremost, I have a deep love for mathematics. There's something incredibly satisfying about the logic
    and structure that maths brings. Whether it’s solving a tricky equation, exploring new theories, or applying mathematical principles to solve real-world problems, math sharpens my mind and encourages critical thinking. The beauty of numbers and the satisfaction of finding the solution to a complex problem never gets old, and I always find new ways to challenge myself.</p>

  <p> Another hobby that keeps me energized is traveling. The chance to explore new places, learn about different
    cultures, and immerse myself in fresh experiences is something I truly treasure. Traveling allows me to broaden
    my horizons, discover unique traditions, and meet people from all over the world. I’m always looking for the next
    destination.</p><p> </p>
