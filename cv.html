  <p> I am currently studying Mathematics with a Year abroad (G-107) at the University of Warwick. I really
    enjoy it. It has given me the analytical toolset to overcome any challenge. I am especially interested in the
    more applied areas of mathematics, especially optimisation and financial mathematics.</p>

  <p> First year average - 81%</p>

  <p> Second Year average - 84% </p>

  <p> Third Year average - 78% </p>

  <p>This is a link to my second year essay on p-adic numbers. I am proud of it as it was selected as an example essay
    for the next year's cohort. It shows my abilities to condense down a complicated topic into something that's easier
    to
    understand.

  <p> I undertook a year of study abroad in Madrid. It has been a great opportunity to immerse myself
  in a different culture and see how mathematics is taught from a different perspective. I felt that it has really
    broadened my horizons, and it has been an experience I will never forget.</p>

    <p> This was a project we did in secondary school where we had to design and build a miniature race car powered
      by a small CO2 cartridge.</p>

    <p> It was very enjoyable. It taught me a lot about working in a team and about time management.</p>

<p> <strong> Excel projects</strong></p>

<p> I am also an advanced user of Excel. In addition to having used it professionally during my time at the IMO. I
  also use Excel a lot for personal projects as well as to keep track of my
  personal finances. Below I have attached download links to the Excel document I use to keep track of my personal
  finances while at university. I find it really helpful to know how my money is being spent. I have inputted dummy
  data into one so you can have an idea of what the spreadsheet looks like and how it can be helpful. I have also
  attatched a blank one if anyone wants to use it to keep track of their own personal finances. </p>
