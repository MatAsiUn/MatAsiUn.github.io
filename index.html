  <p>Hello, my name is Mateo Asin, I am an undergraduate mathematics student at the university of Warwick looking to
  enter the finance industry this summer</p>

  <p>I am currently in the third year of a four year degree with my favourite modules being Financial Mathematics
    and Stochastic Processes. In general I prefer the Analytical branch over the Algebraic branch of mathematics and
  I am looking to do a masters in something to do with Analysis.</p>

  <p> Please feel free to browse my website. You can find different ways to contact me on the contact section</p>
<h2> Hobbies and interests</h2>
  <p> First and foremost, I have a deep love for mathematics. There's something incredibly satisfying about the logic and structure that math brings. Whether it’s solving a tricky equation, exploring new theories, or applying mathematical principles to solve real-world problems, math sharpens my mind and encourages critical thinking. The beauty of numbers and the satisfaction of finding the solution to a complex problem never gets old, and I always find new ways to challenge myself.</p>

  <p> Another hobby that keeps me energized is traveling. The chance to explore new places, learn about different cultures, and immerse myself in fresh experiences is something I truly treasure. Traveling allows me to broaden my horizons, discover unique traditions, and meet people from all over the world. Whether it's a weekend getaway or an international adventure, I’m always looking for my next destination to satisfy my wanderlust.</p><p> </p>

  <p> And lastly, cars are a huge passion of mine. I’ve always been captivated by the design, technology, and
    performance behind cars. Ever since I was a little boy I have been fascinated by them. I remember being able to
    name every car brand at 2 years old!
